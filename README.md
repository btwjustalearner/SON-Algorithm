# SON-Algorithm

I implement the SON algorithm to find all frequent itemsets on top of Apache Spark Framework.

Refer to Chapter 6 from the Mining of Massive Datasets book and concentrate on section 6.4 â€“ Limited-Pass
Algorithms. (Choose either A-Priori, MultiHash, or PCY algorithm to process each
chunk of the data)
